    Aaron Hotchner is another main character in Criminal Minds. He would be described as stoic and caring towards his family and the group. He used to be into law but then discovered he wanted to partipate more in the process of catching criminals so he joined the BAU. Although he has good morals, he is emotionally distant from his family because of his job and this leads to high tensions. :)
