              Criminal Minds is a show that ran from 2005-2020 and has 15 seasons. It is about a group of people at the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit) who investigate crime scenes. The leader of the group, Jason Gideon, is able to bring all the members together while they all face extreme mental pressure. They profle certain types of criminals like serial killers, arsonists, ritual murders, and kidnappers and sometimes have to save specific individuals. They also have to learn how to balance their normal life while being a part of the FBI and some of them face difficulties with their wives, children, and friends.
